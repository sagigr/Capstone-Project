## **Next Word Prediction App**  

#### This Shiny App is designed to predict the next possible word (the prediction based on one or more preceding words in a phrase or sentence).  
#### This application was created as a final assignment of the Capstone Project in the Coursera Data Science Specialization.  
#### For this application I used severeal Natural Language Proccessing models such as n-grams building, Markov's model, Back-off model to produce the predictions.  

### **The Usage and Technical Details**

#### The usage of this application is very intuitive and simple.  
#### Start typing your text in the text field on the screen and immediately after the typing of the first word will appear below up to four options of the next possible word. These options will be displayed on the buttons, clicking on which will automatically type this embodiment as the subsequent word to your already entered text.
and up to 4 possible next words will display in buttons below the field. Click on your intended match to add it to the field.
